<!-- This is the comment section. In perspective there should be three parts to this...
	First, A way to make comments annoyoumously with email contact to the reply
	Second, A way to view all questions.
	Third, A way to respond to questions. Anybody can respond, and others can reply to the reply (inception, right?!) 
		but also rate the other replies.
	As moderator, I want to be able to delete any irrelevant or redundent comments -->
